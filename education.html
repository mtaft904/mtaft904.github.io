            <h2>What Else I'm Learning:</h2>
            &nbsp
            <h3>German</h3>
            <p>I've been studying German since middle school and hope to continue improving my skills. I recently spent
                a semester in Berlin, where I was able to greatly improve my skills through a 12 hour/week German class.
                If you are also learning German (or speak fluently) and would like to have a friendly chat, please reach
                out!
            </p>
            <p>Check out my German portfolio <a href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/glp-mpt37/">here</a> </p>
            <p>Or read my <a href="assets/Hausarbeit.pdf">short essay</a> on the Bauhaus movement in architecture!</p>
            &nbsp
            <h3>Sustainable Business</h3>
            <p>While studying abroad, I took a class on green businesses and learned a lot about what it means for a
                business to be truly sustainable. Check out my group's proposal for a green business that helps turn
                food waste into energy!
