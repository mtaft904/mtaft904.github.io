            &nbsp
            <h3>German</h3>
            <p>I've been studying German since middle school and hope to continue improving my skills. I recently spent
                a semester in Berlin, where I was able to greatly improve my skills through a 12 hour/week German class.
                If you are also learning German (or speak fluently) and would like to have a friendly chat, please reach
                out!

                architecture!</p>
            &nbsp;
            <h3>Web Apps</h3>
            <p>I'm working on a dream journal web app to record dreams. The app is made using flask and sqlite, which I
                am teaching myself in my free time. Currently, the program allows users to create, edit, and delete
                journal entries as well as sort by entry date.</p>
            <p><b>Skills: </b></p>
            <p>python, sqlite databases, flask</p>

            <p>Check out what the <a href="assets/mydreams.jpg">current version</a> looks like</p>
            <p>Or download the code and test it out yourself! <a target="_blank"

            <h3>Sustainable Business</h3>
            <p>While studying abroad, I took a class on green businesses and learned a lot about what it means for a
                business to be truly sustainable. Check out my group's proposal for a green business that helps turn
                food waste into energy!
