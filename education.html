            &nbsp
            <h3>German</h3>
            <p>I've been studying German since middle school and hope to continue improving my skills. I recently spent
                a semester in Berlin, where I was able to greatly improve my skills through a 12 hour/week German class.
                If you are also learning German (or speak fluently) and would like to have a friendly chat, please reach
                out!

            &nbsp
            <h3>Sustainable Business</h3>
            <p>While studying abroad, I took a class on green businesses and learned a lot about what it means for a
                business to be truly sustainable. Check out my group's proposal for a green business that helps turn
                food waste into energy!
